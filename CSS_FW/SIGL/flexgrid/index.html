            <p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and
                see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not
                lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise
                resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,
                to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and
                shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.</p>

            <p>A written word is the choicest of relics. It is something at once more intimate with us and more
                universal than any other work of art. It is the work of art nearest to life itself. It may be translated
                into every language, and not only be read but actually breathed from all human lips; &#8212; not be
                represented on canvas or in marble only, but be carved out of the breath of life itself.</p>

            <p>If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let
                him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away. It is not important that he should
                mature as soon as an apple-tree or an oak. Shall he turn his spring into summer?</p>

            <p>When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and
                absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality.</p>

            <p>If the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers
                and sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal &#8212; that is your success. All
                nature is your congratulation, and you have cause momentarily to bless yourself. The greatest gains and
                values are farthest from being appreciated. We easily come to doubt if they exist. We soon forget them.
                They are the highest reality. Perhaps the facts most astounding and most real are never communicated by
                man to man. The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints
                of morning or evening. It is a little star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have
                clutched.</p>

            <p>We need the tonic of wildness&#8230; At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all
                things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be indefinitely
                wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of nature.</p>

            <p>I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his
                dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in
                common hours.</p>
